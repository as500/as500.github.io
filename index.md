"Hello AS500.world!" 

AS500 is an application built on IBM i, the modern platform that inherited the AS/400 legacy. 

This project is an effort to think about what the IBM i could be.

And what the fantastic communitity that we have can do to make that happen.

It's about recognizing that IBM can't do it alone.  

It's about [cathedrals and bazaars](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/), yes, 
  but it's also about knowing that a vibrant community has both.

It's about taking care ourselves of many of the things we've traditionality looked for leadership from Rochester or Toronto on.

We can do this, if we're willing to share our ideas, and some of our time.


Which things?  Well, take a look at the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/as500/projects) for starters.   It's a bit rough, 
but please take that as an opportunity to contribute.

Thanks for reading... now let's go wag [that long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail_(book))!
