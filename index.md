***"Hello AS500.world!"***

AS500 is an application built on [IBM i](http://ibmsystemsmag.com/blogs/you-and-i/may-2019/ibm-i-for-innovators-by-innovators/), the modern platform that inherited the AS/400 legacy. 


This project is an effort to think about what the IBM i could be.. where we go from here.

And what the fantastic communitity that we have can do to make that happen.


******AS500 is about:******
* Recognizing that IBM can't do it alone.  
* [Cathedrals and Bazaars](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/).
* Knowing that a vibrant community has both.
* Fixing things ourselves that we've traditionality looked to Rochester for.


We can do this, if we're willing to share our ideas, and some of our time.



******Which things?******
Take a look at the [project page](https://github.com/orgs/as500/projects) for starters.   It's a bit rough, 
but please take that as an opportunity to contribute.

Thanks for reading... now let's go wag [that long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail_(book))!
